# ml-py-ex1
The problem come from Andrew Ng's machine learning course projects from Coursera, and 
I'd like to implement them in python instead of matlab/octave
We are asked to implement linear regression with one
variable or feature given, the population of the cities, to predict profits for
 a food truck in that city. We are given the file ex1data1.txt contains the 
 dataset for our problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is
the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a
loss.
